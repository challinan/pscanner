Poor man's process scanner

This little program scans /proc/<pid> entries looking for newly spawned
processes, and reports the command line to the console.

It is called simply by ./pscanner (or in your path, pscanner)
It takes no parameters.

Due to the way the /proc/<pid>/cmdline entry is updated, the algorithm
for displaying a new process is as follows:

1) Detect the new process
2) if the length of it's command line changes, display it
3) if 300ms passes, display it unconditionally

This is because initially, most processes simply show -bash or /bin/sh
when initiall spawned.  Only later does the entire cmdline get stored.

Naturally, some processes that come and go quickly will be missed.

INSTALL

Just type make, it should build on any reasonably modern Linux system.
$ make install > will install to $HOME/bin if it exists, or /usr/bin if not

Comments and enhancements welcome
